                 Espresso was born in Italy in the late 19th century, created out of a desire 
                to make coffee faster and stronger. 
                The word “espresso” means “pressed out,” referring to the method of forcing 
                hot water through finely-ground coffee under high pressure — 
                producing a small, rich, and intense shot of flavor.

                Over time, espresso became the foundation for countless coffee drinks — 
                from cappuccinos and lattes to macchiatos and mochas. 
                Its signature golden crema and aromatic taste 
                turned espresso into a symbol of craftsmanship, 
                enjoyed by coffee lovers around the world.
